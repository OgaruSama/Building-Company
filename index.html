        <h1>Our Services</h1>
        <p>Our services span the full lifecycle of construction -starting with site evalutions and preconstruction through to commissioning, close-out, and beyond.</p>

                <h3>Design Build</h3>
                <p>The Design-Build method is a team effort to deliver a cost-effective, turnkey project. Owners select the architect and contractor as a team that works in tandem under a single contract with one point of contact for the project. The team effort begins with the concept and permeates the entire project, from the design phase, through construction, to completion. In addition to saving time and money, this approach promotes collaboration between the owners, designers and builders.</p>

            <div class="service-col">
                <h3>Costruction Management At Risk (CMAR) </h3>
                <p>The Construction Manager at Risk delivery method fosters collaboration and focuses the entire project team (owner, architect and contractor) on finding the best solutions for the project. As a Construction Manager, Bıtırık has the responsibility for budget control, constructability review, and coordinating all subcontractor procurement and management, while guaranteeing owners a maximum price for construction of the project. While the owner holds the design and construction contracts separately, Bıtırık serves the owner for both the design and construction phases. By working in concert with the architect/engineer early on, Bıtırık can offer valuable expertise when it comes to costs, scheduling and delivery methods, saving our owners time and money. Then, throughout the duration of the project, Bıtırık serves as the single point of responsibility for the project’s successful delivery.</p>

            <div class="service-col">
                <h3>Agency Construction Management</h3>
                <p>While serving as Agency Construction Manager, Bıtırık steps in as the “agent” for the owner throughout every stage of the project. During the design phase, we provide input to the architect/engineer and owner regarding cost estimates, best use of available funds, project scheduling, construction quality, contracting, procurement and other aspects of the project. Unlike CM at Risk or Design-Build, the owner contracts directly with the contractor(s) for the construction phase, with Bıtırık overseeing performance, quality and schedule.</p>
